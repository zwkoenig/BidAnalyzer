# BidAnalyzer — Fresh Start (Vite + React + TS + Tailwind)

This is a clean, working scaffold that deploys to **GitHub Pages** via Actions.
It includes Tailwind, lucide-react, and xlsx.

## Quick Start
1. Create a new repo on GitHub (empty).
2. Upload these files (or clone and push).
3. In the repo: **Settings → Pages → Source = GitHub Actions**.
4. Set **Custom domain** to `www.bidanalyzer.net` and enable **Enforce HTTPS**.
5. Push to `main` — the **Deploy Vite app to GitHub Pages** workflow will run and publish.
6. Replace `src/App.tsx` with your Bid Analyzer component when ready.

## Dev
```bash
npm install 
npm run dev 
```
